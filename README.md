## 📚 Overview

This project serves as an educational resource highlighting three powerful machine learning algorithms that represent the state-of-the-art in different domains:

- **Transformer Models** - Revolutionary neural network architecture using self-attention mechanisms
- **XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting)** - Advanced implementation of gradient boosting for structured data
- **GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)** - Innovative architecture for generating realistic synthetic data

Each algorithm is documented with comprehensive markdown files covering:
- 📋 **Overview** - Core concepts and technical foundations
- 🔍 **Applications** - Real-world use cases and implementations
- 📊 **Case Studies** - Examples of successful deployments
